# Lottie icons for "What We Do" section

Place your Lottie JSON files here. The homepage uses:

- **`what-we-do-icon.json`** – default icon for all four service cards (Design & Creative, Advertising, Development, Strategy & Management).

To use different icons per service, edit `src/components/home/ServicesSection.tsx` and set each service’s `lottie` to a different path, e.g.:

- `/lottie/design.json`
- `/lottie/advertising.json`
- `/lottie/development.json`
- `/lottie/strategy.json`

Export your animations from After Effects (with Bodymovin) or from [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) as JSON and put the files in this folder.
